TODO
=======================


use `<docsdocker-basics.rst>`_ for notes and run basic NodeJS and npm stuff with a named container and bind mounting a directory from this repo

Read webpack 4 docs and use znbmain to get some ideas for the following:

  - https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/ and https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/

  - file-loader or url-loader for files/bg images

  - eslint-loader

  - https://webpack.js.org/loaders/postcss-loader/ for autoprefixer

  - what about sourceMap for dev

===

Once webpack 4 setup is ready and understood go back to React tasks
